# STAN48-2022-finalProject
This is my final project for the Programming for Data Science course I took at LUSEM in 2022. (STAN48)

The first part is written in Python, see Jupyter Notebook file. The second is written in R, see RDM file.

The Machine Learning models trained in this project are not good predictors of anything, nor were they made to be.

The project consists of reading the price history of various cryptocurrencies, transforming such data, and then training two models that predict whether the price is going to rise or not.
